# Tiny Tiny RSS Reader
This is a light and responsive client for [TTRSS](https://tt-rss.org/) built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), and a little bit of [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and [UI Kit](http://getuikit.com/).

## Installation & Usage
1. Grab [the archive](https://github.com/kucrut/ttrss-reader/releases), upload it to your TTRSS server, then unpack it.
2. Make sure *Enable API access* is checked in your TTRSS preferences.
3. Access the app, eg. http://my-ttrss-site.com/reader
4. Provide your username, password, and `SELF_URL_PATH` as set in `config.php`

## Contributing
Pull requests are very welcome! I built this app to satisfy my needs and will update it as I see fit. If you'd like a feature to be added, I'm more than happy to merge it. Right now, the highest priority is to have the CSS restructured and streamlined.
